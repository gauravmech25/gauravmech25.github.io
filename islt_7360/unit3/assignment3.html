    <p id = "para1"> Hi, Everyone! This is my First Webpage (Using HTML and External Style Sheet) and here I will share two project ideas related to web development. </p>
    
<h2 id = "heading2"> Idea 1 </h2>
<p> <u> <b>Ask A Question Blog </b> </u> </p>
    <p>Everyone has questions and need answer to their questions. You may have come across websites like <a href="https://www.quora.com/" target="_blank"> 
    quora.com</a> and <a href="https://answers.yahoo.com/" target="_blank"> answers.yahoo.com</a>. These kind of websites belong to the second stage of development of the World Wide Web (Web 2.0) and are outside scope of this course. Some common funtionality of these websites are listed below :</p>
    
	<ul>
    <li> Create and Manage User Accounts </li>
    <li> Provide user space to ask questions </li>
	<li> Store user reply in Persistant Storage </li>
	<li> Delete posts/replys, close threads etc.</li>
    </ul>

<h2> Idea 2 </h2>
<p> <u> <b>Online Portfolio </b> </u> </p>
<p> Online portfolios arenâ€™t just for certain fields or industries anymore. The importance of having a professional online presence is more important than ever, and an online portfolio will certainly increase my visibility and presence. Creating my portfolio website will allow me to share and showcase my work easily with the employers I would like to work for. As I am currently searching for Full Time opportunities, I will be sharing this portfolio with Employers that I would like to work for.</p>
