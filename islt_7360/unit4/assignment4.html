    <h1> Gaurav's Design Document </h1>
    <hr>
	<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p> The purpose of this website is to create an Online Web-Page-Resume on Github which will have several pages which will contain my Profile data, links to my LinkedIn, Facebook, twitter account as well as snapshots of my relevant certificates etc. In today’s competitive world, job aspirants like to display their skills/experiences and expectations to the potential employer’s in the most effective way possible. The employer seems to look for an extra edge that an aspirant can provide to stand apart from the crowd. Traditional recruiting techniques include a Resume and a LinkedIn profile. However, if an aspirant can provide an online profile of his entire data through an individual webpage it can be a good way to present himself since Resume has a limitation of space and LinkedIn has predetermined format of representing data. I chose this idea because I am Graduating soon and this project can be of great importance to me to present myself to employers as well. </p>
	
	<h2>Audience</h2>
	
		<p>The visitors for this website will be mostly Human Resource department employees of a company, Entrepreneurs, Online Job Recruiters, Staffing Agencies, Academic Professors who are looking for some insights about my Co-Circular profile.</p>
	
	<h2>Design Concept</h2>
	
		<p>I asked a few staff members/student members working with Mizzou Career center so that it would be helpful to design my Online WebPage-Resume based on opinions given by them.</p>
	
		<ul>
		<li><h3>Questions asked to the group of people</h3></li>			
			<li style="list-style-type:none">
			<ul>
			<li>How long does it take for the recruiter to get a first impression whether good or bad when they see an online Web-Page resume?</li>
				<li style="list-style-type:none">
				<ul>
					<li> 120 seconds </li>
					<li> 90 seconds </li>
					<li> 60 seconds </li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			<li>Will you choose to choose to go through an online Web-Page resume despite having a bad first impression?</li>
				<li style="list-style-type:none">
				<ul>
					<li>For me first impression is last impression. If you don’t have the skill to impress a recruiter like me at the first glance, then I won’t prefer going through your resume there-on.</li>
					<li>I will definitely go through your resume despite un-appealing first look. But I would then expect something better in the succeeding part while I go through your resume to continue viewing your profile.</li>
					<li>Off-course a first good impression would be a positive aspect to begin with, but I won’t be judge-mental before I go through your entire Online-Resume.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			
			<li>List important things that you think must be included in an online Web-Page Resume?</li>
				<li style="list-style-type:none">
				<ul>
					<li>Circular Activities in Details.</li>
					<li>Chronological arrangement of all the data.</li>
					<li>Links to appropriate site’s eg: twitter account.</li>
					<li>Relevant Contact Information.</li>
					<li>Avoid presenting irrelevant information.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		<li><h3>Reference Websites</h3>The five websites listed below shows a good or bad artifacts which would be helpful for the final design:</li>
				<li style="list-style-type:none">
				<ol>
					<li> <b>Navigation: </b><a href="http://www.jenniferlundstrem.com/" target="_blank">jenniferlundstrem </a>is a good quality online Teaching Web-Page profile of Jennifer Lundstrem due to its easy navigation from one section to another.</li>
					<li> <b>Simple Layout: </b><a href="http://www.jenniferlundstrem.com/" target="_blank">jenniferlundstrem </a>is a good quality online Teaching Web-Page profile of Jennifer Lundstrem has a simple layout starting with homepage.</li>
					<li> <b>Layout to be avoided: </b><a href="http://dslsrv1.rnet.missouri.edu/~shangy/" target="_blank">shangy </a>is an academic profile of Professor Yi Shang with uneven distribution of information and non-contrasting color scheme and can be worked upon.</li>
					<li> <b>Representing the content: </b><a href="http://sisltportfolio.missouri.edu/kdgrz9/default.html  " target="_blank">Dr. Krista Galyen </a>is online profile of Dr. Krista Galyen of Mizzou which provides highlights of representing content effectively.</li>
					<li> <b>Color scheme used: </b>Since the online Web-Page Resume is an informative site and the viewers will be reading it, I will prefer using dark colors for Writing and light colors for Background.</li>
				</ol>
				</li>
		</ul>
