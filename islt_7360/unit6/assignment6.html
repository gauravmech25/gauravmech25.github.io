    <h1> Gaurav's Evaluation Report </h1>
    <hr>
	<h2>Participants</h2>
		<p> Alex Young is a colleague at my college, and he is also a PhD candidate. He worked at a Big MNC after his Master’s and had good knowledge of Human Resource with technical expertise part. I asked him to evaluate my page as person who takes behavioral interview of Master student. He said that data is quite limited and making constructive comments cannot be conclusive. He evaluated my website using his ASUS ROG Windows 8, 8 GB RAM laptop and his personal Wi-Fi at his place.</p>
		<p>Sumeet is a working professional and doing Job at Computer Science Firm in Chicago. He has given reference for jobs to several people before me and liked the idea of having a web page made to describe yourself, He pointed out definitively that hiring managers are Tech-Savvy these days and this can help you get the extra edge. He mentioned some things about keeping the intent semi-professional.</p>
		<p>Shekhar is a post-doctoral candidate and a good colleague of mine. He also has novice knowledge about web development. Since I am looking to develop my web page not only for companies but also for professor’s who can view my bio-data in-case I have thoughts about applying for PhD after my master’s. He gave me insights about how to keep the web-page casual in some area and Academically professional in others.

		<p>The evaluators liked the concept. Alex told me that the main focus of web page should always be to provide as much information you can provide which is generally limited in a resume. He also told me to have a line between giving more information and irrelevant information. Also alike a resume there is time to get first impression through a web page and it can range from an evaluator to other.</p>
		
		<p>Everyone was positive with the organization of data and Links provided were well in order. All the three had taken web page development related courses some time or the other in their career and they say coding seems fine when they went to view source page tab. The comments given made me realize to provide information and support documents in the form of link or a snapshot to manage the credibility of data. The color scheme seemed ok and they presume keeping a light background made it easy to read the data/information.</p>
	
	<h2>Evaluator Data</h2>
	
		<p>Here are links to the evaluations submitted by all the evaluators of my website: <a href="docs/alex.pdf" target="_blank">Alex</a>, <a href="docs/Sumeet.pdf" target="_blank">Sumeet</a>, and <a href="docs/Shekhar.pdf" target="_blank">Shekhar</a>.</p>
    
	<h2>Recommendation</h2>
	
	<p>Based upon the feedback I received from my evaluators and classmates on the discussion board, I plan on making the following changes to my website:</p>
	
				<ol>
					<li> <b>Navigation tab: </b>I had made my standard one-resume appear as a pdf file attached. The comments suggest it to appear as web page instead of pdf file. I think that is a good idea and will try to implement it in my final project.</li>
					<li> <b>External Links: </b>The external links be come-up in a separate window is another suggestion from Shekhar and Sumeet. Also they told me to add all social networking links like my Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn accounts be added.</li>
					<li> <b>Navigation Menu:  </b>Shekhar showed concern about showing information to be presented while Professor’s take a look. He said that the academician has a different approach and would prefer to go to formal side of web-page for most of the part. He said to provide links to download data like Resume and Covering Letter in home page. Also provide the insights about research activities if any in a separate web-page with brief introduction. Also provide a link to download that in pdf form if possible.</li>
					<li> <b>Color Scheme:  </b>All the evaluators agreed on maintaining a light colored background in order to make it easy to read the content. Also a semi-casual design on the edges can be acceptable.</li>
					<li> <b>Information Vulnerability:  </b>The evaluators told me to take care while posting personal information like certifications etc. They said that web-page can be vulnerable to get infringed and don’t provide download links to data in the form of word document etc.</li>
					
					
				</ol>
	
	
	<h2>Summary</h2>
	
	<p>To summarize I think I need to work a lot on data management and be creative while I present my web-page to anyone. I will try to make the web-page simple yet elegant and avoid making it too colorful. I will try to make sure that all information is readable and brief. </p>
